# satellite-to-maps-pix2pix
A deep learning project using Pix2Pix GAN for translating satellite images into map images. This repository contains the implementation of a GAN-based image-to-image translation model, including dataset preparation, model training, and visualization of results. The project uses the Maps dataset from Berkeley's Pix2Pix examples, enabling applications in geospatial analysis and urban planning.
